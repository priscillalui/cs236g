# CS236G - A GAN-powered Children's Storybook Illustrator

These are the baseline models for the CS236G final project. Currently our experiments span three different models of separate repos, but we plan to consolidate all the repos and codes into this central project repo by milestone 2.

Please refer to each repo for dependencies and directions.
